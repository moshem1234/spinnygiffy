# spinnygiffy

## exes in [thejuice](/thejuice)

## unfun code in [themeat](/themeat)

example command line for building:

`pyinstaller --onefile -w --add-data "catspin;catspin" tkcatspin.py`

then copy and paste exe into [thejuice](/thejuice)

make sure that the folder of images is in the same folder as the original python script

If you want to use the gif exes you need to make your anti-software ignore this folder because it thinks the exes are trojans
